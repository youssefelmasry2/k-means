# Clustering and Association Rule Mining

This Python script performs K-means clustering and association rule mining on a given dataset. It utilizes the scikit-learn library for K-means clustering and the apyori library for the Apriori algorithm.

## Overview

The script takes a CSV file as input, conducts K-means clustering, and identifies association rules within the data. It's a versatile tool for pattern discovery and data segmentation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the script.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn apyori
